# DSC-Captstone-Project-Song-Genre-Classifier
In this analysis I follow the Data Science LifeCycle that we focused on master this semester. I explore the data that we to understand the domain of my dataset. This allows to pull more meaningful conclusions from my results. I prepare my data as apart of the 'Data Prepartion' stage by manipulating the data I explored to get ready to plan my classifying models I want to use it this lab. I build the models and tune the hyper-parameters to find the best possible model for classifying a songs genre. Finally I "bag" all the useful models in my results and create another model which is a collection of al models and analyze its reults.
