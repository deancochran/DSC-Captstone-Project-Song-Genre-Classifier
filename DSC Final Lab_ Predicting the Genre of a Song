our models were infact capable of predicting the genre of a single song. However, our models were only capable of this when presented with the opportunity to estimate more than one genre of a song. This addresses our largest issue in the dataset. Our contained a total of 40% duplicate tracks. Most of which had multiple genre labels as we observed earlier in the exploration of this lab. \n","\n","In this lab we made a few very large assumptions that if were not made, would have completely changed the results of the project. First we assumed that the data had not been balanced to resemble to real world distribution of the frequencies of genres. Becuase of this assumption we were forced to rescale the data and in turn change the overall applicability of our model. Second we assumed that this data had been randomly selected without bias. Obiviously this is not something we are capable of verifying, but with most test labs, it is a common assumption.\n","\n","Since our data wasn't balanced, and we did rebalance the information we must conclude that this model is not applicable to the real world. We do not know the frequencies of the amounts of songs that fit in each genre in the real world. This was something that was unforeseen as the project begun, and it is something I would change if I had more time to work on the project. Addtionally, I would've preferred it use Bayesian optimization to limit the total run time of the project. Using Grid Search to optimize the parameters of 5 total models did not allow this project to be quickly analyzed, but it Bayesian optimization was utilized, I believe the project run time would have reduced significantly."]}]}
